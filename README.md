# catalyticChamberFoam
Solver for catalytic chambers of monopropellant thrusters with Two chemical reactions, one for a surface gas (heterogeneous reaction ) and another for interstitial gas ( homogeneous reaction ), mass Transfers for porous media with mass diffusion coefficient calculation of Chagmant - Esnokg Theory. Mass and Heat transport relations are based on Wakao. For the doctoral theses:
